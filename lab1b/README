lab1b-client.c: the C source file for the client side of the program. Includes the --port option to specify the port number to run the program on, the --log option to keep track of the bytes sent and received in a file, and the --compress option to compress the bytes sent and received over a socket.

lab1b-server.c: the C source file for the server side of the program. Includes the --port option to specify the port number (which has to match the port number specified on the client side) and the --compress option to compress the bytes sent and received, enabling data compression.
