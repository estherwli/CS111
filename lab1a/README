lab1a.c: This file is the C source file. The program has a character-at-a-time, full-duplex terminal I/O that passes inputs between two processes, the parent (terminal) and the child (shell). The --shell option allows you to pass inputs between the terminal and a shell and the --debug option allows for debugging statements that help for debugging the program.

Makefile: Compiles and builds the program and the tarball for submission. Clean cleans up all the unnecessary files that are not needed and make dist creates the tarball.

README: Information about the files that are submitted.
